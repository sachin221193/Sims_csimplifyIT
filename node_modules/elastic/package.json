Run this code somewhere and you'll contact Amazon, create a HTTP service cluster with load balancer, wire it all up, set up firewalls and start serving requests!  All you need to start are the keys and cert from your EC2 account, a keypair in your account, and an AMI that launches apache on boot.\n\n```js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n\n// Change this based on your particular setup.  This works on OS X.\nprocess.env.JAVA_HOME = '/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home/';\n\n// Probably leave these alone.\nprocess.env.EC2_PRIVATE_KEY = __dirname + '/keys/pk-<your file here>.pem';\nprocess.env.EC2_CERT = __dirname + '/keys/cert-<your file here>.pem';\n\nvar async = require( 'async' );\nvar elastic = require( 'elastic' );\nvar ec2 = elastic.ec2Client;\n\nvar cluster = new elastic.LoadBalancedCluster( \n\t{\n\t\t'region': 'us-east-1',\n\t\t'zones': [ 'us-east-1a', 'us-east-1b', 'us-east-1d' ],\n\t\t'name': 'test-lb-cluster',\n\t\t'ami': 'ami-0d3aba64',\t\n\t\t'securityGroup': 'test-cluster-group',\n\t\t'firewallAllow': [\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t'port': 80,\n\t\t\t\t'subnet': '0.0.0.0/0',\n\t\t\t\t// 'group': 'sg-4251245',\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t],\n\t\t'externalPort': 80,\n\t\t'internalPort': 80,\n\t\t'protocol': 'http',\n\t\t'keypair': '<your keypair name>',\n\t\t'type': 't1.micro'\n\t}\n);\ncluster.start( function( error, clusterDns ) {\n\tif( error )\n\t\tconsole.log( error );\n\telse\n\t\tconsole.log( cluster.config.name + ' is running at ' + clusterDns );\n});\n```\n\n## Logging\n\nBy default, elastic spouts progress and status reports to the console, but you can replace the logger with any object that has a '''log( message )``` function.  For example, this will prepend a message \"CUSTOM!\" to every log entry:\n\n```js\nvar elastic = require( 'elastic' );\nelastic.setLogger( {\n\tlog: function( obj ) {\n\t\tconsole.log( 'CUSTOM!' + obj );\n\t}\n} );\n```\n\n## Running tasks on a remote server before shutting it down.\n\nPart of autoscaling is shutting down servers in your cluster when they're no longer needed, and there may be things you want to do on them, such as recovering logs.  Elastic provides some mechanisms to accomodate this.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to perform some task on an instance before it is shut down, you would add something similar to this on that server:\n\n```js\nvar elastic = require( 'elastic' );\n\nvar listener = new elastic.ShutdownListener ( {\n\tlistenPort: 3000,\n\tonShutdown: function( callback ) {\n\t\tconsole.log( 'Remote has been informed of its impending shutdown, and will claim to have finished its shutdown tasks in 10 sec.' );\n\t\tsetTimeout( function() {\n\t\t\tconsole.log( 'Remote is reporting that it has finished shutdown tasks.' );\n\t\t\tcallback( null );\n\t\t}, 10000 );\n\t}\n} );\n```\n\nThis will result in a simple express server running on that instance which executes the \"onShutdown\" function when informed that it is about to be shut down.  On the machine coordinating the server shutdowns:\n\n```js\nvar elastic = require( 'elastic' );\n\nvar notifier = new elastic.ShutdownNotifier( {\n\tnotifyPort: 3000,\n});\n```\n\nwill create a simple object which informs the a given server of an impending shutdown.  Sending the shutdown notification can then be done thusly:\n\n```js\nnotifier.announceShutdown( '127.0.0.1', function( error ) {\n\tif( error )\n\t{\n\t\tconsole.log( \"Controller detected an error informing remote of shutdown.\" );\n\t\tconsole.log( error );\n\t}\n\telse\n\t{\n\t\tconsole.log( 'Controller has been informed that the remote system has completed shutdown tasks.' );\n\t}\n\t// Go on to actually command shutdown of the remote instance.\n} );\n```\n# Executing arbitrary commands on a remote server\n\nYou may find that you need to execute arbitrary commands on a remote server.  If the remote system is running an SSH server, and your local system has SSH installed, and you are using public-key authentication (It feels like a lot, but EC2 linux instances generally work this way), you can use ssh to execute arbitrary commands on a remote server and get the results.  Here's a sample:\n\n```js\nvar elastic = require( 'elastic' );\n\nvar remoteServer = new elastic.RemoteSystem( {\n\t'key': '/Users/cmlacy/SSH-Keys/EC2PrivateKey.pem',\n\t'user': 'ubuntu',\n\t'address': 'ec2-50-17-85-113.compute-1.amazonaws.com'\n} );\n\nremoteServer.exec( 'cd directory-I-care-about ; ls -al', function( error, result ) {\n\tif( error )\n\t\tconsole.log( 'ERROR: ' + require( 'util' ).inspect( error ) );\n\telse\n\t{\n\t\tconsole.log( result );\n\t\tremoteServer.exec( 'df -h', function( error, result ) {\n\t\t\tif( error )\n\t\t\t\tconsole.log( 'ERROR: ' + require( 'util' ).inspect( error ) );\n\t\t\telse\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tconsole.log( result );\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t});\n\n\t}\n});\n```\n\nThat will connect to the server specified using the given private key file, and execute a directory change and ```ls -l```.  If that is successful, it will then connect again and get the disk usage report.  Results of the exec are returned as strings.\n\n# Waiting for a server to start up before issuing commands.\n\nIf you start a new EC2 instance, some time will pass between starting the instance and it becoming available for SSH commands.  Elastic has a utility function which makes it easy to wait until a new instance has started up, ping it periodically to see when it becomes available for login, and then begin issuing commands to it:\n\n```js\nvar elastic = require( 'elastic' );\n\n// Launch a stock Ubuntu 12.10 Server micro instance, and then run uname on it.\nelastic.ec2Client.launchInstance( \n\t'us-east-1', 'ami-7539b41c', 'Nova-Util', 't1.micro', 'sg-d4dba9bc', \n\telastic.Util.waitForStartup( {\n\t\t\t'zone': 'us-east-1',\n\t\t\t'key': '/Users/cmlacy/SSH Keys/Nova-Util.pem',\n\t\t\t'user': 'ubuntu',\n\t\t}, \n\t\tfunction( error, launched ) {\n\t\t\tif( error )\n\t\t\t\tconsole.log( 'ERROR: ' + require( 'util' ).inspect( error ));\n\t\t\telse\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tconsole.log( launched );\n\t\t\t\tlaunched.remoteSystem.exec( 'uname -a', function( error, result ) {\n\t\t\t\tif( error )\n\t\t\t\t\tconsole.log( 'ERROR: ' + require( 'util' ).inspect( error ));\n\t\t\t\telse\n\t\t\t\t\tconsole.log( 'STARTED: ' + result );\n\t\t\t\t} );\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t)\n);\n```\nThe above results in the following output:\n```bash\n{ instance: 'i-932e25e3',\n  ami: 'ami-7539b41c',\n  external: 'ec2-54-234-197-107.compute-1.amazonaws.com',\n  internal: 'ip-10-203-37-142.ec2.internal',\n  type: 't1.micro',\n  zone: 'us-east-1b',\n  remoteSystem: \n   { config: \n      { key: '/Users/cmlacy/Dropbox/Engine/SSH Keys/Nova-Util.pem',\n        user: 'ubuntu',\n        address: 'ec2-54-234-197-107.compute-1.amazonaws.com' } } }\nSTARTED: Linux ip-10-203-37-142 3.5.0-21-generic #32-Ubuntu SMP Tue Dec 11 18:51:59 UTC 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n```\nNote that the ```launched``` object contains not only a lot of critical information about the new system, it also contains a RemoteSystem object (at the property ```remoteSystem```), which can be used to issue commands directly to the new system via SSH.\n\n# License\n\nSome components of this product are released under specific license terms.
